short_answer:
  - question: Explain the purpose of network address translation (NAT) in the context of home networks.
    answer: NAT serves as a mechanism to enable multiple devices within a home network to share a single public IP address. It achieves this by translating private IP addresses used within the home network to the public IP address when communicating with the external Internet. This allows for efficient utilization of limited IPv4 addresses and provides a level of security by hiding the internal network details from the outside world.

  - question: Discuss one advantage and one disadvantage of using network address translation (NAT) in home networks.
    answer: One advantage of using NAT in home networks is that it reduces the need for unique public IP addresses, as multiple devices can share a single public IP address. This helps conserve IPv4 address space. However, a disadvantage of NAT is that it can introduce limitations for certain network applications, such as peer-to-peer connections or hosting servers, as NAT modifies IP addresses and port numbers, making it challenging for external systems to initiate direct connections.

  - question: Describe the role of NAT traversal tools in addressing the limitations of network address translation (NAT).
    answer: NAT traversal tools are designed to overcome the challenges posed by NAT when establishing connections to devices behind NAT. These tools use various techniques, such as UDP hole punching or Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN), to enable direct communication between peers that are located behind NAT routers. NAT traversal tools facilitate the establishment of connections for applications and protocols that rely on direct peer-to-peer communication.
